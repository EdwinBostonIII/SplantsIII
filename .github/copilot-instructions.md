# Splants III - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a **comprehensive operational manual** for a paint-splattered pants business—not a traditional software codebase. The repository contains production specifications, business systems, and operational procedures for creating and scaling a custom apparel business.

## Core Document: SPLANTS_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md
The entire business system is documented in a single 2,000+ line markdown file organized into 8 major parts:
- **Part Zero**: Seven immutable business laws (scarcity, documentation, antifragility, automation, redundancy, coordination, value density)
- **Part One**: Technical production foundations (paint chemistry, fabric-specific methods, heat-setting protocols)
- **Parts Two-Eight**: Operational systems, scaling strategies, marketing, and automation frameworks

## This Repository's Purpose
This is a **knowledge base**, not executable code. When working with this content:

### Key Principles
1. **Precision Matters**: Technical specifications (temperatures, ratios, timings) are validated through real testing—treat them as facts, not suggestions
2. **Systems Thinking**: Every procedure is part of a larger antifragile system designed for continuous improvement
3. **Documentation Culture**: The business model depends on obsessive documentation of every pair produced (photos, identifiers, metadata)

### Working with the Content

**When updating production specifications:**
- Technical details (paint ratios, heat-setting temps, timing) should reference real-world testing data
- Equipment recommendations include specific models with 2025 pricing
- Always maintain the distinction between "tested" and "theoretical" approaches

**When expanding sections:**
- Follow the established voice: direct, technical, non-motivational
- Use specific examples with actual numbers (costs, times, capacities)
- Structure follows: Protocol → Why It Matters → Real Examples → Failure Modes

**When adding new business systems:**
- Consider how it fits the "Seven Laws" framework (especially Law 3: Antifragile Operations)
- Document post-mortem protocols for when the system fails
- Include capacity/efficiency metrics where relevant

### Document Structure Patterns
- **Hierarchical organization**: Parts → Sections → Subsections with clear numbering
- **Action-oriented headers**: "The Law of X", "2025 Definitive Rankings", "Comprehensive Protocol"
- **Specification blocks**: Equipment lists, supply sources, step-by-step procedures with precise measurements
- **Meta-commentary**: Reasoning sections that explain *why* procedures exist
- **Real-world validation**: "Tested by Multiple Teams", "November 2025 Standard", "After Latest Testing"

### Critical Concepts to Understand

**The Seven Laws** (Part Zero): Core principles that govern all operational decisions
- Law 1: Genuine Scarcity (uniqueness documentation system)
- Law 2: Compound Documentation (everything recorded, searchable, reusable)
- Law 3: Antifragile Operations (stress makes the system stronger)
- Law 4: Minimum Viable Automation (manual → documented → templated → automated)
- Law 5: Three Path Redundancy (every critical dependency needs 3 suppliers)
- Law 6: Stigmergic Coordination (environment signals what needs doing)
- Law 7: Value Density Maximization (targeting $150-300/hour output)

**Technical Foundation**: Paint + fabric medium (1:1 ratio) + heat setting = permanent bond
- GAC 900 or Liquitex Professional Fabric Medium recommended
- Heat setting: 300-350°F for 45-55 seconds on cotton/denim
- Wash testing protocol mandatory before selling

**Business Model**: Create documented, unique collectible garments
- Each pair photographed 12+ times with unique identifier (SPL-YYMMDD-###)
- Archive becomes the brand asset (unreplicable at scale)
- Pricing power comes from provable uniqueness, not generic craft quality

### Common Tasks

**Adding new equipment/supplies:**
- Include specific model names, 2025 pricing, where to purchase
- Compare multiple options with pros/cons
- Reference which production scale it's appropriate for

**Documenting new processes:**
- Start with exact step-by-step procedure
- Add "Why This Matters" explanation
- Include capacity metrics (pairs/hour)
- Document failure modes and solutions

**Updating for new year/testing results:**
- Preserve historical context (e.g., "2025 rankings after latest testing")
- Update pricing and availability
- Keep deprecated information if it explains decision evolution

### What This Repository IS NOT
- Not executable software with builds/tests/deployments
- Not version-controlled code requiring linting or CI/CD
- Not a project requiring development environment setup
- Not documentation *about* software—it IS the product

### Tone and Style
- **Directive, not suggestive**: "Do X", not "You might consider X"
- **Precise, not vague**: "45 55 seconds at 350°F" not "heat for a few minutes"
- **Evidence-based**: "Tested across 5,000+ wash cycles" not "should work well"
- **Systems-oriented**: Every action creates leverage or compounds over time
- **Anti-fluff**: No motivational content, generic advice, or aspirational thinking
- **Formatting Constraint**: Do not use em dashes or hyphens in the text. Use spaces or other punctuation instead.

### External Systems
- **Notion/Airtable/Shopify**: Provide only a brief overview of their function within the system. Do not provide extensive technical setup guides for these tools.

### Version Control
- **No Version Tracking**: Do not add guidance on version tracking or changelogs. The document is the source of truth.

### Example of Pattern to Follow
When documenting a new supply source:
```
**[Component Name] (2025 Source):**
Primary: [Specific Product/Vendor] $X.XX [where to buy] ([reason: performance/cost/availability])
Secondary: [Alternative Option] $Y.YY ([trade-offs])
Tertiary: [Emergency Backup] ([when to use])
```

## Quick Reference
- **Primary doc**: `SPLANTS_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` (all business intelligence)
- **README**: Currently minimal placeholder
- **No build/test commands**: This is documentation, not software
- **No dependencies**: Pure markdown knowledge base
- **Version control purpose**: Track evolution of business systems and technical specifications
