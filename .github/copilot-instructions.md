# Splants III - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a **comprehensive operational manual** for a paint-splattered pants business, not a traditional software codebase. The repository contains production specifications, business systems, and operational procedures for creating and scaling a custom apparel business. This is a knowledge base where the documentation itself IS the product, not documentation ABOUT a product.

## Core Document: SPLANTS_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md
The entire business system is documented in a single comprehensive markdown file (2,000+ lines, expanding to 3,000+ with new additions) organized into multiple major parts:
- **Part Zero**: Seven immutable business laws (scarcity, documentation, antifragility, automation, redundancy, coordination, value density)
- **Part One**: Technical production foundations (paint chemistry, fabric-specific methods, heat-setting protocols)
- **Part Two**: Production mathematics and capacity modeling
- **Part Three**: Market reality and strategic positioning
- **Part Four**: Zero capital launch sequence
- **Part Five**: Risk mitigation architecture
- **Part Six**: Daily operations and weekly rhythms
- **Part Seven**: Agentic automation integration
- **Part Eight**: Product expansion pathways
- **Part Nine**: Legal and compliance foundations (newly integrated)
- **Part Ten**: Exit pathways and multi-generational transfer (newly integrated)
- **Appendices**: Regenerative production, studio ergonomics, advanced techniques

## This Repository's Purpose
This is a **knowledge base**, not executable code. When working with this content:

### Key Principles
1. **Precision Matters**: Technical specifications (temperatures, ratios, timings) are validated through real testing across thousands of production hours and hundreds of wash cycles. Treat them as empirical facts, not suggestions. When you see "350°F for 45-55 seconds", this is the result of systematic testing that determined lower temps fail wash tests and higher temps risk fabric damage. Do not round, approximate, or simplify these numbers.

2. **Systems Thinking**: Every procedure is part of a larger antifragile system designed for continuous improvement through stress. The Seven Laws (Part Zero) are not motivational principles but operational physics. Law 3 (Antifragile Operations) means every failure mode must be documented with a post-mortem protocol that extracts permanent competitive advantage from temporary pain. When adding new procedures, always ask: "How does this fit into the Seven Laws framework?" and "What happens when this breaks?"

3. **Documentation Culture**: The business model depends on obsessive documentation of every pair produced (minimum 12 photos, unique SPL-YYMMDD-### identifier, metadata in master database). This is not administrative overhead but the primary growth mechanism. The archive of 1,000+ documented unique pieces becomes an unreplicable moat. When describing processes, always include the documentation layer: what gets photographed, what gets logged, what gets archived.

4. **Evidence-Based Operations**: Every claim must be grounded in real testing data, not theory. "Tested across 5,000+ wash cycles" is acceptable. "Should work well" is not. "November 2025 Standard" indicates this reflects current best practices as of that date. "After Latest Testing" means this supersedes previous information. When you see qualifiers like "team-tested" or "validated", treat these as certification marks.

5. **Financial Realism**: All cost figures, pricing, capacity metrics, and revenue projections are based on actual market data from 2025. When you see "$289-319 for VEVOR 15×15 Auto Open", this is current market pricing. When updating, maintain this level of specificity and cite sources or dates.

6. **Anti-Fluff Mandate**: Motivational language, generic business advice, and aspirational thinking are actively prohibited. Replace "You might want to consider" with "Do X". Replace "This could help" with "This produces Y result in Z timeframe". The voice is directive, technical, and assumes the reader is intelligent and committed.

### Working with the Content

**When updating production specifications:**

*Paint Chemistry and Fabric Medium Ratios:*
- All ratios (1:1 paint to medium standard, 1:1.2 for ultra-premium cotton, 1:1.5 for poly-blends) are derived from wash-test validation. If updating based on new testing, document the test protocol: number of wash cycles, temperature, detergent type, fabric type, failure mode observed.
- When recommending products like Golden GAC 900 or Liquitex Professional Fabric Medium, include: exact product name, size options, current pricing with vendor, performance characteristics, and why it ranks where it does.
- Example: "Golden GAC 900 16 oz jar $34.99 Dick Blick (business account pricing). Zero cracking at flex points after 100 hot washes when heat-set at 350°F for 50 seconds on 100% cotton denim. Preferred over alternatives for maximum flexibility and wash-fastness."

*Heat Setting Protocols:*
- Temperature ranges (e.g., "350-390°F optimal for 100% cotton") represent tested safe zones. Lower bound is minimum for polymer cross-linking; upper bound is maximum before fabric damage.
- Timing ("45-55 seconds") represents the window between incomplete cure (too short) and scorch risk (too long).
- When describing equipment (VEVOR 15×15 Auto Open $289-319), include: model specifics, why it's recommended (auto-open prevents overcooking, slide-out drawer speeds loading), capacity metrics (22-26 pairs/hour with one operator), and when to purchase (Month 3-4 for $400-600 investment that pays back in 8 weeks).

*Fabric-Specific Methodologies:*
- Each fabric type (denim, chino, corduroy, canvas, poly-blend, stretch) has unique paint adhesion properties and requires specific adaptations.
- When documenting: fabric weight (oz), weave type, typical composition percentages, paint mix ratio for that fabric, application technique differences, heat-setting temperature and duration, expected wash durability, and cost per pair.
- Include failure modes: "Issue: Paint cracks at stress points. Cause: Insufficient heat setting. Solution: Increase temp to 375°F and duration to 60 seconds."

**When expanding sections:**

*Voice and Tone Mandates:*
- **Directive, not suggestive**: Write "Mix exactly 1:1 paint to medium" not "Consider mixing equal parts".
- **Specific, not vague**: Write "VEVOR 15×15 Auto Open Heat Press $289-319" not "a decent heat press for around $300".
- **Numbered, not approximate**: Write "22-26 pairs/hour once proficient" not "about 20+ pairs per hour".
- **Causal, not observational**: Write "This creates permanent molecular bond between paint and cellulose fibers" not "This helps the paint stick better".

*Structure Template for New Procedures:*
1. **Comprehensive Protocol**: Step-by-step with exact measurements, timings, temperatures
2. **Why This Matters**: The underlying mechanism or business logic (not motivation, but causation)
3. **Real Examples**: Actual costs, times, capacities from 2025 testing ("Team-tested November 2025: 15 pairs photographed in 36 minutes with Neewer 24×24 softbox setup")
4. **Failure Modes**: What goes wrong, root cause analysis, permanent solution (not just workaround)
5. **Capacity/Efficiency Metrics**: Pairs per hour, cost per pair, revenue per hour, time to proficiency

*Using Specific Examples:*
- Bad: "Source pants from thrift stores"
- Good: "Thrift bulk by pound: $1.20-$2.20/lb at NY/PA regional outlets like Goodwill Outlet (pay-by-pound model). Average pair weighs 1.2-1.8 lbs = $1.44-$3.96 per pair. Yields 60-70% usable inventory after condition screening."

- Bad: "Take good photos"
- Good: "Neewer 24×24 softbox dual kit 5500K $79 + 53-inch white seamless paper roll $35 + 2× A-clamps. Position softboxes at 45° angles 3 feet from subject. Shoot 12 photos per pair in this sequence: front flat lay, back flat lay, left side, right side, front on model, back on model, extreme close-up heaviest splatter zone, close-up lightest zone, interior waistband with SPL ID visible, inside-out showing bleed control, folded for packaging, final poly mailer. Batch processing in Lightroom with preset: 15 pairs edited in 45 minutes."

**When adding new business systems:**

*Alignment with Seven Laws:*
- **Law 1 (Genuine Scarcity)**: Does this system create or preserve provable uniqueness? (e.g., unique identifiers, photo documentation)
- **Law 2 (Compound Documentation)**: Does this system produce permanent, searchable, reusable artifacts? (e.g., customer interaction logs, production videos)
- **Law 3 (Antifragile Operations)**: Does this system have a documented failure mode and post-mortem protocol? What capability is gained when it breaks?
- **Law 4 (Minimum Viable Automation)**: Is this being automated too early? Has it been done manually 50+ times and documented first?
- **Law 5 (Three Path Redundancy)**: For critical dependencies, are three independent suppliers/methods documented?
- **Law 6 (Stigmergic Coordination)**: Does the environment signal what needs doing next without verbal communication?
- **Law 7 (Value Density Maximization)**: What is the $ per hour output? How does this move toward $150-300/hour target?

*Post-Mortem Protocol Template:*
When documenting systems, always include this section:
```
**Post-Mortem Protocol (Conduct Within 24 Hours of Failure):**
1. What happened? (Brutal facts only, no justification)
2. What was the immediate financial/time/reputational cost?
3. What deeper systemic weakness did this expose?
4. What is the smallest possible change that eliminates this entire category of problem forever?
5. What new capability or competitive advantage can we extract from this pain? (Mandatory and non-negotiable)

**Historical Example:**
[Real scenario from actual operations]
```

*Efficiency and Capacity Metrics:*
Every business system should quantify:
- **Time investment**: Setup time (one-time), execution time (per instance), proficiency timeline (hours to mastery)
- **Cost structure**: Fixed costs (equipment), variable costs (per unit), break-even point
- **Capacity impact**: Units per hour before and after, bottleneck identification
- **ROI timeline**: When does this investment pay back? (e.g., "Heat press $319 pays back in 8 weeks at 300 pairs/month via 500% speed increase in heat-setting")

**When documenting marketing and sales:**

*Market Analysis:*
- Include demographic data with sources: "Hudson Falls, NY population: ~7,400. Median household income: $62,237 (2023 census data). Median age: 43."
- Geographic targeting: Specific neighborhoods, cities, regions with rationale: "NYC + Hudson Valley Corridor (Hudson city, Beacon, Cold Spring, New Paltz, Kingston). Artists and creative professionals who relocated from NYC. Higher disposable income ($80k-150k household). Fashion-forward, value handmade."
- Channel performance with benchmarks: "Instagram organic: 1-3% conversion rate. TikTok organic: variable, can spike to 15% with viral content. Email marketing: 15-25% open rate, 3-8% click-through. Pop-ups: 30-50% of attendees purchase."

*Pricing Architecture:*
- Full cost breakdown per tier:
  * Variable costs: blank pants ($3-35), paint+medium ($1.50-4), packaging ($2-3.50), fees (Shopify 6%, payment 3%), shipping ($8-12)
  * Labor valuation: time per pair × hourly rate ($30-50/hour)
  * Gross margin target: 60-75% depending on tier
- Pricing tiers with specific ranges and positioning: "Tier 1: Archive Collection $175-195 (pre-made, immediate availability). Tier 2: Guided Custom $215-245 (customer preferences, 7-10 day turnaround). Tier 3: Premium Selection $265-295 (premium blanks, priority). Tier 4: Customer-Supplied $145-175 (highest margin at 75-82%)."

*Revenue Modeling:*
- Use tables with monthly progression showing: pairs sold, average price, revenue, cumulative revenue
- Provide three scenarios: Conservative (high probability), Realistic (moderate probability), Aggressive (requires optimal conditions)
- Include assumptions: "Assumes 20% month-over-month growth in pairs sold, 2-3% monthly price increases, 15% repeat customer rate by Month 6."

**When documenting operational procedures:**

*Daily/Weekly Rhythms:*
- Specific time blocks: "8:00 AM-12:30 PM: Production Block. Batch production 5-8 pairs painted. Phone recording on tripod. No interruptions. Social media notifications OFF."
- Parallel processing opportunities: "12:30-1:30 PM: Lunch + Heat-Setting. Eat while heat-setting yesterday's batch. Saves 60 minutes daily."
- Hard boundaries: "5:00 PM: Hard Stop. Business day ends. Preserves energy and creativity. Prevents burnout. Non-negotiable except active pop-up days or shipping deadlines."

*Batch Production Optimization:*
- Time-motion analysis tables showing: phase, time for single unit, time for batch of 5, time savings percentage
- Example: "Paint 5 Pairs: 75 min total = 15 min/pair (vs. 25 min/pair solo). Batch cleanup: 8 min total = 1.6 min/pair (vs. 5 min/pair solo). Efficiency gain: 38% time reduction through batching."

**When adding new techniques or innovations:**

*Advanced Technique Documentation:*
- Exact tool specifications: brand, model, where to purchase, cost
- Step-by-step with precision: "Load brush with paint until bristles saturated but not dripping. Stand 3.2 feet from surface. Flick wrist at 45° downward angle. Velocity determines splatter size: slow flick = large drops, fast flick = fine mist."
- Visual outcome description: "Creates organic radiating pattern. Heavy concentration at center, progressive fade to edges. High-contrast against base fabric color."
- Difficulty and proficiency timeline: "Intermediate technique. Requires 20-30 practice pairs to achieve consistent results. Common beginner error: standing too close (paint gobs) or too far (no impact)."
- Market positioning: "Customers perceive this technique as +$45-65 premium vs. standard splatter due to intentional composition and artistic control."

**When integrating legal, compliance, or regulatory content:**

*Legal Architecture:*
- Treat compliance as antifragile infrastructure, not administrative burden. Frame as "Immutable Sentinels" or "Foundations" — systems that prevent single regulatory events from collapsing otherwise perfect operations.
- Cost-benefit framing: "LLC formation: $200-400 in NY. Creates impenetrable barrier between personal assets and product liability claims. File same month cumulative revenue exceeds $25,000 (typically Month 5-6)."
- Specific regulatory citations: "FTC Textile Labeling Act requires fiber content accurate to 3%, country of origin, RN number. Non-compliance fine: $50,964 per violation (2025). Compliance cost: $0.14 per heat-transfer label at scale."
- Turn compliance into competitive advantage: "PFAS-free certification (Golden Fluids and Liquitex Professional confirmed via SDS sheets) enables marketing 'Tested PFAS-Free, 100-Wash Verified' for +$45 average selling price increase observed in comparable brands Q3 2025."

Critical Success Factors: [Non-obvious requirements]
Common Errors: [What beginners do wrong]
Verification: [How to confirm success]
```

**Meta-Commentary Patterns:**

*Why This Matters (Causal Explanation):*
Always explain the mechanism, not just the rule. Poor: "Heat setting is important." Good: "Heat setting triggers cross-linking of acrylic polymer chains with cotton cellulose fibers at molecular level. Below 275°F this reaction does not occur. Above fabric-specific maximum, you scorch or melt. This is chemistry, not preference."

*Deeper Reasoning:*
Include sections titled: "Why This Matters", "Deeper Reasoning", "The Physics/Chemistry/Economics", "Critical Insight". These explain the strategic or scientific basis.

Example:
```
**Why This Compounds So Brutally:**
At pair 300 you possess a library of training material that allows a new team member to reach 90% proficiency in under 48 hours. At pair 800 you possess thousands of video clips that can be edited into viral Reels demonstrating authentic process (the single most believable marketing possible). At pair 1,500 you possess data patterns that reveal exactly which color combinations sell 400% faster. Documentation is not administrative overhead. It is the primary growth steroid.
```

*Failure Mode Documentation:*
Every significant procedure should include:
```
**Failure Mode:** [What goes wrong]
Businesses/procedures that [don't follow this] stay [negative state]. [Consequence 1]. [Consequence 2]. [Ultimate failure].
```

Example:
```
**Failure Mode:**
Creating "similar" pairs without this level of documentation immediately commoditizes the product. You enter a race to the bottom on price against AliExpress dropshippers. Within six months you are selling at $79 to compete and hating every minute. The archive is the difference between a business and a legacy.
```

**Real-World Validation Stamps:**

### Critical Concepts to Understand

**The Seven Laws** (Part Zero): Core principles that govern all operational decisions
- Law 1: Genuine Scarcity (uniqueness documentation system)
- Law 2: Compound Documentation (everything recorded, searchable, reusable)
- Law 3: Antifragile Operations (stress makes the system stronger)
- Law 4: Minimum Viable Automation (manual → documented → templated → automated)
- Law 5: Three Path Redundancy (every critical dependency needs 3 suppliers)
- Law 6: Stigmergic Coordination (environment signals what needs doing)
- Law 7: Value Density Maximization (targeting $150-300/hour output)

**Technical Foundation**: Paint + fabric medium (1:1 ratio) + heat setting = permanent bond
- GAC 900 or Liquitex Professional Fabric Medium recommended
- Heat setting: 300-350°F for 45-55 seconds on cotton/denim
- Wash testing protocol mandatory before selling

**Business Model**: Create documented, unique collectible garments
- Each pair photographed 12+ times with unique identifier (SPL-YYMMDD-###)
- Archive becomes the brand asset (unreplicable at scale)
- Pricing power comes from provable uniqueness, not generic craft quality

*Example Application:*
When adding photography lighting, don't write: \"Get some good lights for about $100.\"

Instead write:
```
### Photography Lighting (2025 Top Value)

**Neewer 24\u00d724 Softbox Dual Kit with 5500K Bulbs**

**Specifications:**
- Model: Neewer 24x24 inch Professional Softbox Continuous Lighting Kit
- Price: $79 (Amazon Prime, as of November 2025)
- Vendor(s): Amazon (Prime), Neewer Direct (+$8 shipping), B&H Photo ($84)
- Technical specs: Two 24\u00d724 inch softboxes, 85W CFL 5500K daylight bulbs, adjustable light stands (26-86 inches), carrying case included

**Why This Specific Product:**
1. Consistent 5500K color temperature eliminates post-processing color correction (saves 2-3 minutes per 12-photo batch)
2. Softbox diffusion prevents harsh shadows on fabric texture (critical for showing splatter detail)
3. Dual-light setup allows 45\u00b0 positioning for even coverage (professional studio standard)
4. Price point 60% below equivalent Profoto/Godox kits with 90% of performance for this application

**Timing of Purchase:**
- Optimal: Month 2-3 when photographing 50+ pairs/month
- Rationale: Inconsistent natural light causes color matching issues and limits shooting windows to 10am-2pm. Artificial light enables evening batch photography sessions.
- Capital requirement: $79 + $35 (seamless backdrop) = $114 total
- Expected ROI: Saves 8-10 hours/month in re-shooting and editing time = $240-500/month value at $30-50/hour

**Capacity Impact:**
- Before: 12 pairs photographed in 90 minutes (natural light, midday only)
- After: 12 pairs in 36 minutes (consistent lighting, any time of day)
- Improvement: 60% time reduction + 10-hour daily shooting window extension
- Bottleneck resolution: Removes weather/time-of-day dependency from production schedule

**Execution Phase:**
1. [Action step with precise measurements/parameters] ([timing])
   - Critical: [Non-obvious detail that causes failure if missed]
   - Verification: [How to confirm this step succeeded]
2. [Continue for each step]

**Quality Check Phase:**

- Expert level (50+ reps): [Z minutes]

### Why This Matters (Underlying Logic)
[Explain the causal mechanism or business reason]

Example: \"This preparation phase removes factory sizing, a chemical coating on new fabric that prevents paint from bonding to cellulose fibers at molecular level. Skipping pre-wash results in paint delamination after 3-5 wash cycles regardless of heat-setting quality. The 15-minute investment prevents 100% of this failure mode.\"

**Updating for New Year or Testing Results:**

*Year Transition Protocol:*
```
When transitioning from 2025 → 2026 content:

1. **Preserve Historical Context**
   - Change: \"2025 Definitive Medium Rankings\" → \"2026 Definitive Medium Rankings (Updated from 2025)\"
   - Add dated archive section: \"### Historical: 2025 Rankings\" (collapsed/indented)
   - Explain: \"2026 testing revealed [new finding] that changes recommendation from [old] to [new]\"

2. **Update Pricing with Date Stamps**
   - Change: \"VEVOR Heat Press $289-319 (November 2025)\" → \"VEVOR Heat Press $304-339 (January 2026, +5% from 2025)\"
   - Note market factors: \"Price increase due to [tariff/supply chain/demand]\"

3. **Update Availability and Sources**
   - If supplier changed: Document why old supplier no longer primary
   - If product discontinued: Show replacement with migration path
   - Example: \"Golden GAC 900 (2025 recommendation) replaced by Golden GAC 900 Series II (2026) with improved flexibility. Same mixing ratios apply. Original GAC 900 still acceptable if in stock.\"

4. **Preserve Deprecated Information with Explanation**
   - Don't delete old methods; demote them with reasoning
   - Example:\n   ```\n   ### 2026 Heat Setting Method\n   [Current best practice]\n   \n   ### Deprecated: 2025 Iron Method\n   Historical context: Prior to heat press affordability, iron method was standard.\n   Why deprecated: 500% slower, inconsistent pressure distribution, operator fatigue.\n   When still acceptable: First 10-20 test pairs before equipment investment.\n   ```

5. **Testing Result Integration**
   When new testing invalidates prior claims:
   \n   ```\n   ### [Subject] (After [Month Year] Testing)\n   \n   **Previous Understanding (Pre-[Month]):**\n   [What we thought before]\n   Based on: [Original test conditions]\n   \n   **New Finding ([Month Year]):**\n   [What testing revealed]\n   Test protocol: [How we discovered this]\n   Sample size: [N pairs tested]\n   Conclusion: [Updated recommendation]\n   \n   **Impact on Operations:**\n   - [Change #1 to procedure]\n   - [Change #2 to costs/timing]\n   - [Change #3 to quality expectations]\n   ```

Example: \"After November 2025 Testing: Liquitex Professional Fabric Medium now performs identically to Golden GAC 900 in blind wash tests (100 hot cycles, no statistically significant difference in cracking or fading). Previous 2024 testing showed 15% lower performance, but formula was updated by manufacturer between test periods. Both now acceptable as co-primary recommendations. Liquitex advantage: 15-20% lower cost per ounce in 16 oz jars. Golden advantage: slightly better color clarity with metallics.\"
```

**Adding External Tool/Platform Integration:**

*Digital Systems Documentation Template:*
```
### [Platform/Tool Name] (Role in Business System)

**Purpose:** [One sentence: what business function this serves]

**Integration Point:** [Where in workflow this lives]

**Setup Requirements:**
- Account type: [Free/Paid tier]
- Cost: $X/month at [volume] (free until [threshold])
- Technical requirements: [Browser/app/API access]
- Data migration: [Import from where, if switching]

**Configuration for Splants Operations:**

*Database Structure:* (if applicable, e.g., Notion/Airtable)
- Table 1: [Name] with fields: [Field1 (type)], [Field2 (type)]...
  Purpose: [What this tracks]
- Table 2: [Name] with fields...
  Purpose: [What this tracks]
- Relations: [How tables connect]

*Automation Rules:* (if applicable, e.g., Zapier)
- Trigger: [When X happens on Platform A]
- Action: [Do Y on Platform B]
- Example: \"New Shopify order → Create row in Google Sheet inventory tracker → Send confirmation email template → Add customer to Klaviyo segment\"

**Daily/Weekly Usage:**
- Who uses it: [Person A / Person B / Both]
- Frequency: [X times per day / once per week]
- Time per session: [Y minutes]
- What gets entered: [Specific data points]

**Data Retention and Backup:**
- Export frequency: [Weekly/monthly]
- Export format: [CSV/JSON/PDF]
- Backup location: [Google Drive folder path]
- Retention policy: [Keep forever / X years]

**Brief Overview for Non-Technical Operators:**
[2-3 sentences explaining what this tool does in plain language, avoiding jargon]

Example for Notion: \"Notion is a flexible database and documentation platform. We use it as the central repository for all product records (every pair's photos, specs, and sales data), customer information, and production procedures. Think of it as a custom-built business operating system that lives in your browser.\"

Example for Shopify: \"Shopify is the e-commerce platform that hosts our online store. When a customer buys a pair, Shopify processes payment, sends confirmation email, and adds the order to our fulfillment queue. It handles all the technical aspects of running an online store so we focus on making pants.\"

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

### What This Repository IS NOT
- Not executable software with builds/tests/deployments
- Not version-controlled code requiring linting or CI/CD
- Not a project requiring development environment setup
- Not documentation *about* software—it IS the product

### Tone and Style
- **Directive, not suggestive**: "Do X", not "You might consider X"
- **Precise, not vague**: "45-55 seconds at 350°F" not "heat for a few minutes"
- **Evidence-based**: "Tested across 5,000+ wash cycles" not "should work well"
- **Systems-oriented**: Every action creates leverage or compounds over time
- **Anti-fluff**: No motivational content, generic advice, or aspirational thinking

### Example of Pattern to Follow
When documenting a new supply source:
```
**[Component Name] (2025 Source):**
Primary: [Specific Product/Vendor] $X.XX [where to buy] ([reason: performance/cost/availability])
Secondary: [Alternative Option] $Y.YY ([trade-offs])
Tertiary: [Emergency Backup] ([when to use])
```

## Quick Reference
- **Primary doc**: `SPLANTS_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` (all business intelligence)
- **README**: Currently minimal placeholder
- **No build/test commands**: This is documentation, not software
- **No dependencies**: Pure markdown knowledge base
- **Version control purpose**: Track evolution of business systems and technical specifications
